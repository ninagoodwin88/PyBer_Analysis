# PyBer_Analysis
Matplotlib
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze the various city types and calculate the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver, using pandas and python; as well as display the information visually using a line chart.
## Results
The results of the summary indicate several things:
*   Urban cities bring in the most revenue.
*   Urban cities have the lowest fare per driver.
*   Rural cities bring in the least revenue.
*   There is a direct correlation between more rides and lower fares.

## Election Audit Summary
Based on the analysis of the summary four suggestions would be:
*   Decrease the amount of rural drivers.
*   Market more in the suburban areas offer ride shares.
*   Give weekly rates to commuters in suburban areas to increase rides.
*   Do away with rural route as it barely generates revenue.
